Readme Introduction

This is a guide for how to set up your readme for you IronHack Application

1. Name of your Application

VIRO

2. Keywords

virus tracking, climate dependence, respiratory and enteric virus, foodborne outbreaks

3. Description of the datasets and function design

The project aims at using datasets belonging to the following categories:

Normals Monthly from Climate Data Online
(https://gis.ncdc.noaa.gov/geoportal/catalog/search/resource/details.page?id=gov.noaa.ncdc:C00822)

Tables indicating trends from The National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System
(http://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/)

Foodborne Outbreak Online Database
(http://wwwn.cdc.gov/foodborneoutbreaks/) 

4. Brief Description

 Currently, the objective is to relate the trends in respiratory virus cases to the monthly climatic conditions like temperature and precipitation. Further, illness caused through foods via viruses in different regions can be incorporated in the application

 Fill in the structued description:
 * Map View:
	1. [Y/N] Basic Map with specific location (your map is located in a meaningful place, city of west lafayette for example)
	2. [Y/N] Markers for location of markets
	3. [Y/N] Labels for markets' names
	4. [Y/N] InfoWindow to show detail information of a market
	5. [Y/N] [describe] Any other cover on the map (for example, cloud cover to show the weather effect)

	TODO

 * Data Visualization:
	1. [Y/N] [describe] Use Graph? What is the type? (bar chart, pie chart, radar chart ...)
	2. [Y/N] [List] Any interaction available on the graph? List them (enable click on numbers, drag on lines, change time/variables ...)
	
	TODO

 * Interaction Form:
	1. [Y/N] [List] Any information output? list them. (text field, text area, label, plain HTML ...)
	2. [Y/N] [List] Any operation option (filters)? List them. (search markets, search vegetables, filter based on price, sort based on convenience ...)
	3. [Y/N] [List] Any information input? List them. (comments, markers, user preference ...)
	4. [Y/N] [List] Interaction with Map? List them. (filter on price will affect map markers, sort on price will affect map markers, ...)
	5. [Y/N] [List] Interaction with data visualization? List them. (filter, sort, set variables ...)

	TODO

5. Build Case

How can we build and access your project on a Linux/Unix machine if you use external dependencies besides HTML/CSS/Javascript?
List the dependencies you used, such as python, node.js, etc.
List the steps we should follow to build the project.
Your project will be built on Amazon Web Service, EC2, ubuntu 14.01 instance

TODO

6. Test Case
Which browsers did you test your project on? Chrome, IE, Edge, Safari, or Firefox?

TODO

7. Additional information You Want to Share with Us
E.g. any problems you faced/fixed, where you reached out to for help, etc.

I am having a difficult time figuring out how data from different datasets needs to be combined to produce required infortmation.
